## Sock Shop on Applatix

The following instructions will help you deploy and run the Sock Shop application on Applatix. 
Applatix makes it simple and consumable for enterprises to build, test and deploy containerized apps in public cloud at scale whether it is a legacy app or microservices based app. 
Applatix clusters leverage Docker containers and Kubernetes as foundation and are deployed in customer's cloud account- AWS or Google Compute Platform. Multiple Applatix clusters across multiple clouds can be centrally managed from the Applatix portal.  
You can review how to deploy sock shop in this [demo movie](https://vimeo.com/220878494).

2. Once Applatix cluster is installed, integrate it with the github repo and under **Catalog** menu item you will see a **sock shop** app.
3. In Applatix, for the stateful microservices create EBS volumes with the names **sock-shop-order-db**, **sock-shop-user-db**, **sock-shop-cart-db**, **sock-shop-cart**,  **sock-shop-shipping**,  **sock-shop-order**.
4. Deploy sock shop from the Applatix **Catalog**.

It will take 1-2 minutes to deploy and you can see all the services in the web console.
